# Regex tutorial and reference guide

Regex or Regular Expression is defined (atleast by wikipedia) as 'a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern.

## Summary

My hope with this tutorial is for you to have a general understanding of what regex is and how to use it. Think of this as a starter guide for you to familiarize yourself with the syntax and even a future refence guide.
